# JaxNetwork
Practice with Jax and implementing trainable NNs 

The following is very rough flexible implementation of NN using Jax. The network is very simple, it takes only 2 inputs, and outputs a value between 0 and 1. The network is meant to learn only the simple rule of any logic gate, including OR, AND, XOR, XNOR etc.
